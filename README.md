# Equity-Finance-Helper-LLM

I've developed a news research tool using LLM for effortless information retrieval where users can input article URLs and ask questions to receive relevant information from the financial domain. This is an end-to-end LLM project that can be used by financial analysts.

### Key Features

1. Load URLs or text files containing URLs to fetch article content.
2. Process article content through LangChain's UnstructuredURL Loader
3. Construct an embedding vector using Llama-7b embeddings and leverage FAISS, a powerful similarity search library, to enable swift and effective retrieval of relevant information
4. Interact with the LLM's by inputting queries and receiving answers along with source URLs.

### Why It Matters
In the fast-paced world of equity analysis, having a tool that provides accurate and comprehensive suggestions is crucial. This project offers precisely that - a strategic advantage for informed decision-making in the dynamic realm of stock market analysis.

### Impact
Empowering users with actionable insights, this Language Model is designed to streamline and elevate the equity evaluation process. Stay ahead of the curve with precision and efficiency.
